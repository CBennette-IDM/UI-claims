	Downloaded by Laura Kincaide from https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/Quick_Statistics_Information_by_County.htm
	on April 5, 2020. Naviage to the web address above, and find the header "Initial Claims by County", and select
	the relevant time period. Note that these are pdfs and I then used Adobe Acrobat's "Conver to Excel" feature
	to save the data in a more useful format.

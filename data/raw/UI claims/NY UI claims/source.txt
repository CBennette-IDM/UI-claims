Beneficiaries-and-Amounts by Region-and-County-February-2020
	This pdf was downloaded from https://labor.ny.gov/stats/UI/Unemployment-Insurance-Data.shtm 
	by Laura Kincaide on April 5, 2020. I then used Adobe Acrobat's "Convert to Excel" feature
	to get this into a more useable version. 

	Note: on the the most current version of the website only the current month and the cumulative
	claims since January of the current year are available. To get data going farther back in time
	I changed the URL of the pdf. For example, the URl for February of 2020 is 
	https://labor.ny.gov/stats/UI/Beneficiaries-and-Amounts-by-Region-and-County-February-2020.pdf
	I just changed "February-2020" to "January-2020" to get the January 2020 data.
